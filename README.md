## Prerequisites

### Terminal Requirements

For proper emoji display:
- Make sure your terminal emulator supports Unicode and emoji rendering
For proper emoji and icon display:

1. Install a Nerd Font (recommended):
```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian:
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts
cd ~/.local/share/fonts
curl -fLO https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.1.1/JetBrainsMono.zip
unzip JetBrainsMono.zip
fc-cache -fv
```

2. Configure your terminal:
- Set your terminal font to "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font" (or another Nerd Font)
- Ensure your terminal emulator supports Unicode and emoji rendering
- Set your locale to support UTF-8: `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8`

Alternative fonts:
- Noto Color Emoji (`sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji`)
- Fira Code Nerd Font
- Hack Nerd Font

If emojis aren't displaying correctly:
1. Check your terminal supports Unicode: `echo -e "\xf0\x9f\x93\x81"`
2. Verify locale settings: `locale`
3. Try updating your terminal emulator to a newer version

Note: Some terminal emulators like Alacritty, iTerm2, Konsole, and Kitty are known to work better with unicode/emojis.

## Performance

CupidFM is optimized for speed and efficiency. Our comprehensive test suite (63 tests across 8 suites) and performance benchmarks demonstrate excellent performance characteristics:

### Core Data Structure Performance

- **Vector Operations:**
  - Add 100 elements: **0.645 μs** (645 ns)
  - Element access: **1.95 ns**
  - Capacity management: **651-749 ns**

- **VecStack Operations:**
  - Push/pop: **0.167 μs** (166.5 ns) - **50% faster** after optimization
  - Peek: **2.03 ns** (100x faster than push/pop, as expected)
  - Large stack (1k elements): **15.6 μs**

### File System Operations

- **Path Join:** **38-138 ns** depending on complexity
- **Directory Reading:**
  - Small directories (`/tmp`): **42.6 μs** (hot cache)
  - Medium directories (`/usr/lib`, 99 entries): **10.5 μs** (hot cache)
  - Large directories (`/usr/bin`, 2,254 entries): **325.4 μs** (hot cache)
- **Cold Cache Performance** (realistic browsing scenario):
  - First read is **1.75-3.8x slower** than hot cache, demonstrating the importance of OS page caching
  - Warm steady-state matches hot cache performance

### Optimizations Applied

1. **VecStack Optimizations** - Achieved **32% performance improvement**:
   - Cached Vector length to eliminate redundant function calls
   - Used `Vector_set_len_no_free` for push operations
   - Pre-allocated capacity (10 elements) to reduce reallocations

2. **Memory Safety** - All critical memory issues fixed:
   - Safe `realloc` usage with temporary pointers
   - Proper memory cleanup in all data structures
   - Zero memory leaks (validated with AddressSanitizer and Valgrind)

3. **String Operations:**
   - `strlen`: **1.90 ns**
   - `strncpy`: **7.34 ns**
   - `snprintf`: **54.52 ns**

## Configuration

### Keybinds (Quick Reference)

All keybinds are configurable via `~/.cupidfmrc`. These are the defaults.

### Browser Mode (Directory/Preview)

| Action | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Move up | `KEY_UP` |
| Move down | `KEY_DOWN` |
| Go to parent directory | `KEY_LEFT` |
| Enter directory | `KEY_RIGHT` |
| Switch Directory/Preview pane | `Tab` |
| Exit | `F1` |
| Edit file (from Preview pane) | `^E` |
| Copy | `^C` |
| Paste | `^V` |
| Cut | `^X` |
| Delete | `^D` |
| Rename | `^R` |
| New file | `^N` |
| New directory | `Shift+N` |
| Fuzzy search | `^F` |
| Select all (current view) | `^A` |
| Open console | `^O` |

### Search Prompt

| Action | Key |
| --- | --- |
| Move selection | `KEY_UP` / `KEY_DOWN` |
| Page | `PageUp` / `PageDown` |
| Accept (keep filtered list) | `Enter` |
| Cancel (restore previous selection) | `Esc` |

### Edit Mode

| Action | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Move cursor | `KEY_UP` / `KEY_DOWN` / `KEY_LEFT` / `KEY_RIGHT` |
| Save | `^S` |
| Quit | `^Q` |
| Backspace | `KEY_BACKSPACE` |

### Default Keybindings

cupidfm comes with a set of **default keybindings**. On **first run**, if cupidfm cannot find a user configuration file, it will **auto-generate** one at:

```
~/.cupidfmrc
```

Below is a screenshot showing the start up

![preview](img/startup.png)

This auto-generated config file includes default bindings, for example:
The default includes `key_search=^F` (Ctrl+F) for fuzzy search and `key_new_dir=Shift+N` for creating directories, both of which you can change by editing `~/.cupidfmrc` and restarting CupidFM.

```
key_up=KEY_UP
key_down=KEY_DOWN
key_left=KEY_LEFT
key_right=KEY_RIGHT
key_tab=Tab
key_exit=F1

key_edit=^E
key_copy=^C
key_paste=^V
key_cut=^X
key_delete=^D
key_rename=^R
key_new=^N
key_search=^F
key_new_dir=Shift+N
key_select_all=^A
key_undo=^Z
key_redo=^Y
key_permissions=^P
key_console=^O

edit_up=KEY_UP
edit_down=KEY_DOWN
edit_left=KEY_LEFT
edit_right=KEY_RIGHT
edit_save=^S
edit_quit=^Q
edit_backspace=KEY_BACKSPACE
edit_copy=^C
edit_cut=^X
edit_paste=^V
edit_select_all=^A
edit_undo=^Z
edit_redo=^Y
```

**Immediately after creating** `~/.cupidfmrc` for the first time, CupidFM will display a **popup** in the interface letting you know where it wrote your new config.

### Editing the Config File

After CupidFM creates this file, you are free to **edit** it to customize keybindings or add new mappings. Here are some rules/notes:

1. **Valid Formats**

   - You may use special ncurses names like `KEY_UP`, `KEY_DOWN`, `KEY_LEFT`, etc.
   - You can assign **Ctrl**+**key** by using a caret, e.g. `^C`.
   - Single characters (`a`, `b`, `x`) are also valid.

2. **Commenting and Whitespace**

   - Lines beginning with `#` are treated as comments and ignored.
   - Blank or whitespace-only lines are also ignored.

3. **Sample**

   If you only want to change the exit key from **F1** to **Esc**, you might do:
   ```text
   key_exit=27
   ```
   since **ASCII 27** is **Esc** in decimal form.

4. **Restart Required**

   - Changes to `~/.cupidfmrc` take effect **next time** you launch CupidFM.

### Where CupidFM Searches for the Config

1. **`~/.cupidfmrc`**  
   By default, CupidFM looks for this file in your home directory.

2. **No config found?**  
   - CupidFM loads **hard-coded defaults** (arrow keys, F1, etc.) 
   - Automatically **writes** a new file to `~/.cupidfmrc`, which you can later edit.

3. **Config exists but can’t be loaded?**  
   - CupidFM keeps defaults and shows a **Configuration Errors** popup instead of overwriting your config.

### Common Changes to the Config

- **Changing the Exit Key**  
  ```text
  key_exit=F10
  ```
  or
  ```text
  key_exit=27  # 27 = ESC
  ```
- **Using Emacs-like Keys**  
  If you prefer `Ctrl+P` for up and `Ctrl+N` for down:
  ```text
  key_up=^P
  key_down=^N
  ```
- **Remapping Left/Right**  
  ```text
  key_left=KEY_BACKSPACE
  key_right=KEY_ENTER
  ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Config Not Created**:  
  Make sure you have a valid `$HOME` environment variable set. If `$HOME` is missing or empty, CupidFM will try to create the config in the current directory instead.
- **Invalid or Unknown Key**:  
  If you enter an invalid key name, it will be ignored and remain at default. Check the logs or run from a terminal to see error messages.
- **Changing Keybindings**:
  - If something stops working after changes, revert the line or remove it to fall back to the default.
  - You can always delete `~/.cupidfmrc` and relaunch to regenerate a fresh config.

With these steps, you can **fully customize** your keybindings in `~/.cupidfmrc`. If you ever lose or remove it, CupidFM will rewrite the default file and let you know on the next run!

## Plugins (CupidScript)

CupidFM can load Cupidscript plugins (`.cs`) on startup.

By default it loads from your home directory:

1. `~/.cupidfm/plugins`
2. `~/.cupidfm/plugin`

Local/repo plugin folders are supported, but are disabled by default (to avoid accidentally executing repo scripts):

- Enable local plugin loading with: `CUPIDFM_LOAD_LOCAL_PLUGINS=1`
- Then CupidFM will also search:
  - `./cupidfm/plugins` and `./cupidfm/plugin`
  - `./plugins` and `./plugin`

### Plugin Hooks

- `fn on_load()`
- `fn on_key(key)` -> return `true` to consume the keypress
- `fn on_dir_change(new_cwd, old_cwd)`
- `fn on_selection_change(new_name, old_name)`

### CupidFM Script API

- `fm.notify(msg)` / `fm.status(msg)` - show a notification
- `fm.popup(title, msg)` - show a popup
- `fm.console_print(msg)` / `fm.console(msg)` - append to the in-app console (`^O` by default)
- `fm.prompt(title, initial)` -> `string|nil`
- `fm.confirm(title, msg)` -> `bool`
- `fm.menu(title, items[])` -> `index|-1`
- `fm.cwd()` - current directory
- `fm.selected_name()` / `fm.selected_path()` - current selection
- `fm.cursor()` / `fm.count()` - cursor index + list size
- `fm.search_active()` / `fm.search_query()` - fuzzy search state
- `fm.pane()` - `"directory"` or `"preview"`
- `fm.bind(key, func_name)` - bind a key to a function (key can be `"^T"`, `"F5"`, `"KEY_UP"`, or a numeric keycode)
- File operations (integrated with undo/redo):
  - `fm.copy(path_or_paths, dst_dir)`
  - `fm.move(path_or_paths, dst_dir)`
  - `fm.rename(path, new_name)`
  - `fm.delete(path_or_paths)` (trash)
  - `fm.mkdir(name_or_path)`
  - `fm.touch(name_or_path)`
  - `fm.undo()` / `fm.redo()`
- `fm.reload()` - request a directory reload
- `fm.exit()` - request CupidFM to quit
- `fm.cd(path)` - change directory (absolute or relative)
- `fm.select(name)` / `fm.select_index(i)` - move selection (best effort)
- `fm.key_name(code)` / `fm.key_code(name)` - convert between keycodes and names

### Key Features to Implement

## Command Line Interface (CLI) Feature

### Overview

The **Command Line Interface (CLI)** for **cupidfm** will introduce a powerful way for users to perform common file operations directly from the application, similar to a terminal within the file manager. This feature will enable users to execute commands like navigating directories, opening files, copying/moving files, and even running system commands without leaving the **cupidfm** interface.

### Planned Features for the CLI

- **Command Input**: 
  - Users will have access to a bottom command bar where commands can be typed.
  - Basic commands like `cd`, `ls`, `open`, `copy`, `move`, `delete` will be supported.

- **Command History**:
  - Pressing the **Up/Down arrow keys** will cycle through previously executed commands, similar to a traditional terminal.

- **Tab Completion**:
  - Auto-complete file and directory names by pressing **TAB** while typing a command.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Clear and descriptive error messages will be displayed in the command bar when commands fail (e.g., "File not found" or "Permission denied").

- **Custom cupidfm Commands**:
  - Extend the functionality of traditional file operations with cupidfm-specific commands, such as:
    - `tree`: Display the directory tree structure.
    - `preview [file]`: Quickly open a file in the preview window.
    - `info [file/dir]`: Show detailed information about a file or directory.

- **System Command Integration**:
  - Run standard shell commands like `grep`, `find`, `chmod`, and others directly from the cupidfm command bar.

---
